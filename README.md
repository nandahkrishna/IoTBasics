# Basics of IoT/Systems
These assignments aim to introduce students to the work we do in the IoT/Systems group. Follow the instructions below to get started.

## Installing Requirements
We recommend having a Linux or macOS development environment for convenience. We recommend using Anaconda to manage your packages.
Install Python 3 (version >= 3.7.3 recommended), along with pip.
For the other requirements, run:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`
## Modules
Complete each module and get your code verified before moving onto the next. Use StackOverflow to clear any programming doubts. If you're stuck, don't hesitate to ask a TA for help.

Good luck, and have fun!
